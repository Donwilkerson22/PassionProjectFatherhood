        <p> 
            I was introduced to this passion officially on May 14, 2022 when my daughter Imarah was born.
            Since early childhood, I was fascinated and motivated by my strong and tight knit family. 
            Even as a youngster I knew that I wanted to continue my family legacy by being a father 
            and have children of my own.
            Today I am inspired by my own parents. 
            They have always done all they can do to pour greatness into me. 
            My Mom: a strong minded and stern woman that sets the bar for the standard of conduct and behavior. 
            My Dad: A hard working and integral man who is a constant reminder to do things right the first time and to reach down and lift others up.
            I am also inspired by the other fathers I meet who share valuable experiences and virtues.
